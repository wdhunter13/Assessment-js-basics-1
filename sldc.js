// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//Correct Order
//1. Planning
//2. Analysis of Requirements
//3. Design
//4. Implementation
//5. Testing and Integration
//6. Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = "The process of defining user expectations for a new sofware being built or modified"
const design = "The process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems"
